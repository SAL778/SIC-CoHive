Selenium with Python

To verify correct installation try to run smoketest.py. You should get "Recieved!" on correct install.

Change config.py with the path to your chromedriver before beginning.

You need both backend and frontend running before running scripts
-> frontend: npm run dev
-> backend: python3 manage.py runserver 

Run all tests via runtests.py
